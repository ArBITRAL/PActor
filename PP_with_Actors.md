Probabilistic Programming
================


**Motivating Problems**

- Two-sided matching based on attributes
-- random two-sided matching based on ranked list of identifier (http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/papers/coopmas12.pdf)

- Car manufactures from ActorSpace

**Research questions**

- ways to introduce probability to actors



**Background**

(https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fose-icse2014.pdf)

- the purpose of ordinary program is to be excuted
- the purpose of probabilistic program is to speficy probability distribution for program variables
- the meaning of probabilistic program is the expected return value
- probabilistic inference is the problem of computing the distribution
  which was implicitly specified by a probabilistic program
